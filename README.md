# GloVeShortTermSimilarity

Utilizes the Stanford GloVe model (https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe) with its pre-trained word vectors to compare two strings with a relatively high accuracy. It does have a significant runtime, but might be something to utilize for this project. To use this, you must install the model using the above link. Also created a program that uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm for string comparisons. This has a significantly shorter runtime but a lower accuracy.
